# Netflix Banner Blocker

## What
A Chrome extension to remove the annoying Netflix ad banner. When you have the extension enabled, the banner ad at the top of the Netflix website (the one with the autoplaying video with 20 minutes of autoplaying trailer video) will be removed from the page automatically, so you can use Netflix in peace!

## Why? 
I really hate the banner ads on Netflix. They're intrusive, distracting, and god damn it, I'm paying for this stupid service! I just want the content that I'm paying for; I don't want to be advertised to. 

## Installation 
This extension isn't listed on the Chrome extension store. It may be in the future (although I have to imagine Netflix and Google wouldn't shine too kindly on its presence there), but for the time being you only have to jump through a couple easy hoops to add this to Chrome.
